  <h1>JAMstack</h1>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Fast, secure sites & dynamic apps</p>
    <p>Served without webservers</p>
    <p>
      The JAMstack is not about specific technologies (about operating systems, specific web
      servers, backend programming languages, or databases). It‚Äôs about following some paradigms
      with building the web that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of
      scaling, and a better developer experience.

      <p>A site made with the JAMstack doesn't have to include all of these attributes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          J: Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript,
          running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even
          vanilla JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          A: All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs,
          accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be
          <b>custom-built</b> or leverage <b>third-party</b> services.
        </li>
        <li>
          M: Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for
          content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Why the JAMstack?</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section style="text-align: left">
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>Pre-built and served over a CDN</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it
        comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section style="text-align: left">
    <h3>Higher Security</h3>
    <p>Reduce surface area, leverage third-party services</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are
        reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section style="text-align: left">
    <h3>Cheaper, Easier Scaling</h3>
    <p>Deploying a stack of files</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a
        matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include
        scaling in all of their plans.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section style="text-align: left">
    <h3>Better Developer Experience</h3>
    <p>Loose coupling and separation of controls</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging,
        and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a
        separate stack for content and marketing.

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Entire Project on a CDN</h3>
    <p>Distributed (instead of living on a single server) and pushed to the edge</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Because JAMstack projects don‚Äôt rely on server-side code, they can be distributed instead of
        living on a single server. Serving directly from a CDN unlocks speeds and performance that
        can‚Äôt be beat. The more of your app you can push to the edge, the better the user
        experience.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Everything Lives in Git</h3>
    <p>
      <code>git clone</code>
    </p>
    <p>Install deps with a standard procedure</p>
    <p>(No databases to clone, no complex installs)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        With a JAMstack project, anyone should be able to do a git clone, install any needed
        dependencies with a standard procedure (like npm install), and be ready to run the full
        project locally. No databases to clone, no complex installs. This reduces contributor
        friction, and also simplifies staging and testing workflows.
      </p>
    </aside>

  <section>
    <h3>Modern Build Tools</h3>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Take advantage of the world of modern build tools. It can be a jungle to get oriented in and
        it‚Äôs a fast moving space, but you‚Äôll want to be able to use tomorrow‚Äôs web standards today
        without waiting for tomorrow‚Äôs browsers. And that currently means Babel, PostCSS, Webpack,
        and friends.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Automated Builds</h3>
    <p>Markup is prebuilt, content changes won‚Äôt go live until you run another build</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        Because JAMstack markup is prebuilt, content changes won‚Äôt go live until you run another
        build. Automating this process will save you lots of frustration. You can do this yourself
        with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that includes the service automatically.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Atomic Deploys</h3>
    <p>Re-deploy hundreds of files (all or nothing changes)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        As JAMstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying hundreds of
        files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state while the process
        completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do ‚Äúatomic deploys,‚Äù where no
        changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Instant Cache Invalidation</h3>
    <p>Ensure all changes are live</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        When the build-to-deploy cycle becomes a regular occurrence, you need to know that when a
        deploy goes live, it really goes live. Eliminate any doubt by making sure your CDN can
        handle instant cache purges.
