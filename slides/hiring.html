      Leaders of companies that go from good to great start not with “where” but with “who.” They
      start by getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right
      people in the right seats. And they stick with that discipline—first the people, then the
      direction—no matter how dire the circumstances.

      Making hiring a critical priority at a company is worth the resources. We must find the right
      individuals for the job, and build healthy teams.

    <ol>
      <li>Target skill level</li>
      <li>Scorecard</li>
      <li>Critical competencies</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="notes">What else do we need before we start?</aside>
  </section>

  <section style="text-align: left">
    <h3>1. Resume or Assessment</h3>

    <p>Candidates are selectively filtered based on their <u>work experience</u>.</p>
    <p>However, candidates may choose to stand out by completing an <u>assessment</u>.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This step and the next step are performed by full-time recruiting staff.</p>
      <p>This is essentially a social call with a fairly predictable choreography.</p>

    <p>Questions from easy to hard, keeping in mind target skill level.</p>

    <h3>3. <u>Primary Interview</u></h3>

    <ol>
      <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Mock pull request</li>
      <li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Toy problem <em>or</em> take-home project</li>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>What are we missing?</p>
      <p>
        PR: Review a pull request with the candidate. The interviewee has a week prior to the
        interview to review and test the pull request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Toy problem vs project: Potentially a pair programming opportunity. Candidate is given the
        decision prior to the interview. Whiteboarding problems are relevant to the position they're
        applying for and demonstrate important concepts to the position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design: Show an example UX design mockup (front-end) or entity relationship (back-end) and
        discuss with designers or peer engineers an approach to create an app with specified
        constraints. <strong>Front-end</strong>: functional and design questions are discussed;
        <strong>Backend-end</strong>: data structures and design patterns are discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking shop: Are they asking questions about what everybody does and how things work? Are
        they curious? Do they treat everyone they meet with respect, and show interest in what they
        do?
      </p>
      <p>
        From the NY Times: What kind of animal would you be? And why? What qualities of your parents
        do you like the most?

  <h3>Avoid Traps</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Don't reject the candidate for irrelevant reasons</li>
    <li class="fragment">Use the same process every time</li>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>What's an example of an irrelevant reason?</p>
    <p>How can we avoid personal bias?</p>
    <h4>Diversity</h4>
    <p>Lisa Borders, president of the WNBA, says:</p>
    <blockquote>"I’m always looking for the opposite of what I am, for the most part."</blockquote>
    <p>
      We should be aware that we're prone to careful around people who are different than us, but we
      also know that diverse teams are more creative and capable than one-dimensional teams.
    </p>
    <p>What other traps might we face?</p>
